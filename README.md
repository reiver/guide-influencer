# GUIDE: Influencer

by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

This is a **guide** on being an **influencer**, and **influencing**.
**Influcing** is (directly or indirectly) part of what is done by — **journalists**, **reporters**, **marketers**, as well as others..

## Target Audience

If you make content for _everyone_, then you make content for _no-one_.

There is no _content_ that will be interesting to everyone.
There is no _article_ that everyone will be interested in reading.
There is no _video_ that everyone will be interested in watching.
There is no _audio_ that everyone will be interested in listening to.

Each _article_, each _video_, each _audio_, will be interesting to someone, and uninteresting to others.
Very likely more people will find it uninteresting than will find it interesting.

But that is OK.
Because typically an **influencer** is _not_ trying to **influence** everyone with a single piece of content.
Typically an **influencer** has a specific **group of people** — i.e., a **target audience** — in mind when they create a piece of content.

To be effective at **influencing**, an **influencer** needs to write content for a specific **target audience**.

Maybe that **target audience** is —
* females,
* between the ages of 25 and 34,
* who speak English,
* who live in British Columbia, Idaho, Northern California, Oregon, Southeastern Alaska, or Washington State,
* who are married, and
* who have at least one child.

Alternatively maybe the **target audience** is —
* males,
* in their teens or 20s,
* who are fans of the Dragon Ball fiction.

Or, maybe the **target audience** is —
* anyone who eat cheese.

Or, the **target audience** could be —
* all executives,
* that work at a corporation with at least 1,000 employees and contractors.

Or even, the **target audience** could be —
* anyone who is a has watched a video made by Dr. Joe Blow.

Etc.

⚠️ For an **influencer** to be effective at **influencing**, an **influencer** needs to №1 know who their **target audience** is, and №2 create bespoke content for that **target audience**.

## Community

If you want to create a new **community** ⁠— then you need to define the in-group, and put everyone else in the out-group.

An **influencer** should try to create a **community** around themselves.

And thus —

⚠️ An **influencer** needs to (implicitly or explicitly) define who is and isn't in their **in-group**.

The **target audience** will be in the **in-group**.
But the **in-group** migh also include individuals who are not in the **target audience**.
