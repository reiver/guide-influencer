by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

---

This is a **guide** on being an **influencer**, and **influencing**.
**Influcing** is (directly or indirectly) part of what is done by — **journalists**, **reporters**, **marketers**, as well as others..

## Target Audience

An effective **influencer** is creating content for specific **group of people**.

If you create content for everyone, then you create content for no-one.

⚠️ An **influencer** needs to be able to effectively decide who is their **target audience** — and thus who they are writing for.

## Community

If you want to create a new **community** ⁠— then you need to define the in-group, and put everyone else in the out-group.

An **influencer** should try to create a **community** around themselves.

And thus —

⚠️ An **influencer** needs to (implicitly or explicitly) define who is and isn't in their **in-group**.

The **target audience** will be in the **in-group**.
But the **in-group** migh also include individuals who are not in the **target audience**.
