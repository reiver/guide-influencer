This is a **guide** on being an **influencer**, and **influencing**.
**Influcing** is (directly or indirectly) part of what is done by — **journalists**, **reporters**, **marketers**, as well as others..

## Who Is Your Target Audience?

If you are going to become an effective **influencer** then you need to decide — _who is your **target audience**_.

If you make content for _everyone_, then you make content for _no-one_.

There is no _content_ that will be interesting to everyone.
There is no _article_ that everyone will be interested in reading.
There is no _video_ that everyone will be interested in watching.
There is no _audio_ that everyone will be interested in listening to.

Each _article_, each _video_, each _audio_, will be interesting to someone, and uninteresting to others.
Very likely more people will find it uninteresting than will find it interesting.

But that is OK.
Because typically an **influencer** is _not_ trying to **influence** everyone with a single piece of content.
Typically an **influencer** has a specific **group of people** — i.e., a **target audience** — in mind when they create a piece of content.

To be effective at **influencing**, an **influencer** needs to write content for a specific **target audience**.

Here are a number of example **target audiences** —

Example **target audience** №1 —
* females,
* between the ages of 25 and 34,
* who speak English,
* who live in British Columbia, Idaho, Northern California, Oregon, Southeastern Alaska, or Washington State,
* who are married, and
* who have at least one child.

Example **target audience** №2 —
* males,
* in their teens or 20s,
* who are fans of the Dragon Ball fiction.

Example **target audience** №3 —
* anyone who attends the Dragon Ball meetup in Vancouver.

Example **target audience** №4 —
* anyone who eats cheese.

Example **target audience** №5 —
* all executives,
* that work at a corporation with at least 1,000 employees and contractors.

Example **target audience** №6 —
* anyone who is a has watched a video made by Dr. Joe Blow.

Etc.

⚠️ For an **influencer** to be effective at **influencing**, an **influencer** needs to №1 know who their **target audience** is, and №2 create bespoke content for that **target audience**.

## Community

A strategy for an **influencer** to reach their **target audience** is to engage a **community**.

Sometimes this is an existing **community**.
Sometimes the **community** is created by the **influencer**.

The idea of a **community** and the idea of a **target audience** are related but often different.

Sometimes the **target audience** and **community** could be the same thing.

For example —
* anyone who attends the Dragon Ball meetup in Vancouver.

But also, more often the **target audience** could be different than but related to a **community**.

For example, imagine if an **influencer**'s **target audience** is —
* males,
* in their teens or 20s,
* who are fans of the Dragon Ball fiction.

A **community** that is related to but different from this might be —
* the people who regularly attend the Dragon Ball meetup in Vancouver.

Also for example, imagine a YouTuber whose **target audience** is —
* people who are interested in vintage toys from the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

A **community** that is related to but different from this might be —
* people who joined that YouTuber's Patreon.

Sometimes the **community** already exists.
But sometimes the **community** is created by the **influencer**.

If you want to create a new **community** ⁠— then you need to define who the in-group is, and put everyone else in the out-group.

⚠️ An **influencer** needs to (implicitly or explicitly) define who is and isn't in their **in-group**.
